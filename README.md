# Movie-Database-CS210
This project analyzes my personal movie collection (and maybe) future watchlist using Python and some libraries. It explores genres, ratings, runtimes, and trends, applying data cleaning, EDA, and visualization techniques to uncover patterns and insights into my movie preferences and viewing habits for CS 210 Data Science.
